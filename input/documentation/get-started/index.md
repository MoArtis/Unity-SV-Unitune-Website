After installing the package, you can start using **Unitune** by adding a **UnituneSource** component to a GameObject.

The component can be added by pressing the **Add Component** button and selecting **UnituneSource**.

<?# Figure Src="/img/documentation/get-started-add-component.webp" Class="text-center" /?>

The **UnituneSource** component relies on the built-in **AudioSource** component so make sure that the GameObject has one.
If not, an **AudioSource** component will be added automatically.

When added, the **UnituneSource** component should look like that:

<?# Figure Src="/img/documentation/get-started-added-component.webp" Class="text-center" /?>

At this point, the component is ready to be used.
